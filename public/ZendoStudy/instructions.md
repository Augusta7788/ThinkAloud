### Thinking Aloud

A key part of this study involves **thinking aloud** as you work through each task. Your verbal responses will be recorded to help us understand how participants approach problem-solving tasks.

- You should **continuously express your thoughts**, observations, and reasoning clearly and audibly.
- Describe what you notice, what you are considering, and how you are approaching the problem.
- There are **no wrong answers** when thinking aloud â€” we are interested in your reasoning process, not just your conclusions.

> **Reminder:** Please avoid long periods of silence or unrelated conversation. Stay focused on explaining your thoughts throughout each task.

### Timing

For each task, you will have **4 minutes** to observe the scenes and think aloud as you try to figure out the hidden rule.

This timer is **not to rush you**. It is simply there to ensure you have enough time to reason through each task and then move on to a new one.
