# Introduction

Welcome to our study. This is a complex example study to show how to embed react components into the study page. In this example, the react components are responsible for rendering the stimuli, but the revisit framework handles the answer tracking.

This study is a replication of a graphical perception study by Clevland & McGill with the Heer & Bostock extension.
