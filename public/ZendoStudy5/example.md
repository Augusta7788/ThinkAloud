## Example: How Do the Stars Light Up?

In this task, each group of cones follows a special rule.  
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
If the rule is being followed, the star in the corner will light up <strong>yellow</strong>.  
If the rule is not being followed, the star will stay <strong>empty</strong>.
</p> 

Below are two examples to show how these rules work:

These are just two possible rules. 
There are many different things that might make the star light up, such as:

- The **number** of cones
- The **color** of cones
- The **size** of cones
- The **direction** they are facing
- Or other features!

### What Does "Thinking Aloud" Mean?

As you look at each scene, speak your thoughts out loud — even if you're unsure. You might say things like:

- “I notice this one has two cones…”
- “Maybe it’s because they are all blue?”
- “Hmm, that one’s different… could it be the tilt?”

Just try to **talk through your reasoning process**, like you're explaining it to someone else. There are no wrong thoughts!

### Reminder About Timing

For each task, you will have **4 minutes** to observe the scenes and think aloud as you try to figure out the hidden rule.

- The timer is there to give you enough time to explore your thoughts.
- Use the full time to discuss what patterns you notice and what you believe might explain when the star lights up.
- You will **not be able to enter your guess** until the timer has finished, so focus on reasoning out loud throughout the task.

After the timer ends, you will be prompted to type in your guess about the rule.

### Example of a Guess

When asked to guess, you'll see a box like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://thchara.github.io/ThinkAloud/ZendoStudy5/images/exampleTextBox.png" alt="Example guess" width="400"/>
</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
For example, if it looks like the star lights up if all the cones are red, you would write something like:  
"at least one cone is red"
</p>

<p style="color:red; margin-bottom:5px;">
  <strong>Important Reminder:</strong> Your responses and think-aloud recording will be reviewed.  
  If your recording contains unrelated speech, silence, or doesn’t reflect an attempt to reason about the task,  
  your submission <strong>may be rejected</strong>.
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> 
  That said, there is <strong>no "correct" way to think aloud</strong>.
  As long as you continuously voice your thoughts and stay focused on figuring out the hidden rule, you are doing it right!
