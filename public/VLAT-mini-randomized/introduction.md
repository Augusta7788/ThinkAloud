This is a reVISit adaptation of the original VLAT questionnaire from Kwon et al.

From their study: 

## What is mini-VLAT?

mini-VLAT is developed to measure users' ability to read, understand, and
use data visualizations to solve problems. This test is a web
adaptation of the original test.

The test contains 12 multiple-choice questions about 12 data
visualizations. It will take approximately 5 minutes to finish this
test. For each question, you will be given a static data
visualization (right) and a problem to solve (left). Choose the BEST
answer to the questions. If you don't know the answer, select
'skip'. We suggest maximizing your browser window."
